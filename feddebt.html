<h2 id="who-owns-the-federal-debt-">Who Owns the Federal Debt?</h2>

<p><img src="feddebt.png" alt="A Pretty Chart from FRED"></p>

<p>The headline number, over $21 trillion in the most recent report, gets all the publicity, but it isn&#39;t very informative. It&#39;s like saying Warren Buffet has a $21 million dollars in debts. It doesn&#39;t mean much until we know the ability to repay. It means even less when we found out he &quot;borrowed&quot; $1,000,000 from his retirement account and another million from his wife. Who owns that debt is also important. The headline number loses its anxiogenic effects when taking these two things into account.</p>
<p>All data taken from FRED, who&#39;s most recent series end with 2017.</p>

<h4 id="who">Who</h4>

<p>As a percentage of GDP, total federal debt is 103.7%. This is broken down into two categories:  held by the public (75.0%) and held by agencies or trusts of the federal government (28.7%).</p>

<h5 id="owing-itself">Owing Itself</h5>

<p>About one quarter of the debt is held by various trusts, most notably the Social Security Trust Fund and the federal employee retire funds, called intergovernmental holdings. This is only a partial accounting of a future liability, but it isn&#39;t real debt, yet. It is no more or less real than any other future liability: medicare/medicaid, defense spending, pick your favorite line in the budget. These programs can be changed or funding changed, and they certainly will be changed. At some point we will need to deal with these upcoming costs, but that is true of many things. The non-marketable bonds are way of internal accounting, and in consolidated financial systems they cancel and aren&#39;t included in the total federal debt.</p>

<p>It is similar to how I have worked at trading companies, and we have an internal exchange for our strategies to trade against each other. This prevents us from self-trading on the public markets, but also provides a way to better account for strategy PNL. But in no way are these real profits or losses, for each loss booked on one strategy a profit is booked on another.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much we have promised people, this small slice of future promises isn&#39;t actual debt, so can remove them from the total. If you want to understand future liabilities, I suggest you look for other more complete projections that include everything. They are indeed very scary.</p>

<h5 id="owing-the-fed">Owing the Fed</h5>

<p>The other 75.0% is called &quot;held by public&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;the public debt&quot; which means everything). These are actual marketable securities. But part of it isn&#39;t really held by the public.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve holds about a seventh of it, 14.5% of GDP. In 2008, just a decade ago, this was only hovering a little above 3%. This is debt that will probably never be sold again. A large part of it is long-end debt that was part of the QE program and will likely be allowed to mature this providing a slow, orderly decrease in duration of the Fed&#39;s bond portfolio. It will basically cease to exist with time. That is, it will be monetized.</p>

<h5 id="owing-me-and-you">Owing me and you</h5>

<p>About 62.6% of GDP is held by private investors. This is where we are getting to the important components of the federal debt. These are people or corporations that hold a legal claim that the government cannot take away without defaulting. There is no account shuffling that can be used to pay this down. However, it is a little different owing a loan shark and owing your wife.</p>

<p>One of the problems with a high debt load is that taxes will have to be raised or money printed to pay. If I have loaned money to the government though, I&#39;m partially protected against that. They would be raising my taxes to pay me back, or I&#39;d be taking my bond coupons to pay my taxes. At some level, the government could institute a program to take federal securities in exchange for taxes: you own us, we own you, let&#39;s just call it even. Unfortunately, debt ownership isn&#39;t distributed very evenly, so it is mostly the wealth or those with pension funds that most protected against the debt load.</p>

<h5 id="owing-fat-tony">Owing Fat Tony</h5>

<p>That knee-capping wise guy part of the debt is in the international holdings. That is about 32% of GDP, up from 17% a decade ago. The good news is that it is slightly falling. It maxed at 35% in 2014, and has been slowing but steadily declining.</p>
<h5 id="the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</h5>

<p>So how bad is the federal debt? Pretty good actually. At worst, we are at two-thirds of GDP, but we can also deduct another 5% for the amount owed the states probably. No state will put the federal government in a position to default. They will roll the debt forward or cut pension benefits.</p>

<p>There is a very good argument to be made that only about half the federal debt is impactful. The really ugly part of the debt is only that 32% of GDP owed outside the United States. Compared to other nations around the world, we are in incredibly good shape. I&#39;m unsure how they handle internal accounting, so it is very difficult to compare debt figures across nations since each has their own accounting standards. Even the IMF promulgates a 107% of GDP figure for the US, and I haven&#39;t seen a study that tries to dissect and compare the debt structure of nations.</p>
